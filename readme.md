# Prefab

Prefab generates new projects, all it needs is a name.

```bash
  npm install -g prefab
  prefab <projectName>
```

Prefab creates a new project, in the ./projectName directory.
It will fill in author information from your git config,
and plug the project name in appropriate places.

It also adds common dependencies to your package.json
and downloads common client side dependencies from
the internet.
